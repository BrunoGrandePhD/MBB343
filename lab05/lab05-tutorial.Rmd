  - Identify and describe the aesthetics of each geom
  - Create multi-layered plots by combining multiple geoms
  - Transform how data is mapped to visual features using scales
  - Reorder categorical axes using factors with the `forcats` package
  - Divide data into sub-plots using facetting
  - Configure how the axes of the individual facets are laid out
  - Save a plot to disk as PDF and PNG images
  - Differentiate between PDF and PNG images
