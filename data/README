This README describes the datasets used in this course.
The download date is listed to help explain any descrepancy if the data set is updated in the source. The code snippet in each section can be used to regenerate the dataset to the latest date (if the link still works).

## NCHS Mortality Surveillance Data

US government's CDC - NCHS (National Center for Health Statistics) reporting on mortality % by penumonia by weeks. It contains percentage of total deaths caused by penumonia due to either seasonal flu or covid-19 in that week (`percent_total`), the baseline of percentage of deaths caused by seasonal flu (`baseline`) as expected, and the threshold for what is considered as epidemic.
The original data contains some additional information about the dataset in the first few columns. They're removed and saved as `nchs_mortality_report_cleaned.csv` to make loading into R easier.
