## Tutorial

### Learning Objectives

- Explain importance of deciding which test to use before testing (P-hacking)
- Identify outliers for exclusion from tests
- Perform parametric (Pearson) and non-parametric (Spearman) correlation in R
  - Differentiate between both types of correlation
  - Visualize the correlation for a dataset using the `ggplot` package
  - Identify which type of correlation is most appropriate for a dataset
  - Calculate the correlation coefficient using `cor()`
  - Calculate the P-value using `cor.test()`
- Perform parametric (t-test) and non-parametric (Wilcoxon test) two-sample tests
  - Differentiate between both types of tests
  - Visualize the data in each group of a dataset using the `ggplot` package
  - Identify which type of test is most appropriate for a dataset
  - Calculate the P-value using `t.test()` and `wilcox.test()`
