## Tutorial

### Learning Objectives

- Perform linear dimensional reduction using PCAs
  - Explain why PCA is useful for graph-based clustering and non-linear dimensional reduction
  - Determine the dimensionality of the dataset (optimal number of principal components)
- Perform graph-based clustering
  - Explain advantages of graph-based clustering compared to other forms of unsupervised clustering
  - Evaluate graph-based clusters
- Perform uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the `umap` package
  - Differentiate between linear and non-linear dimensional reduction
  - Visualize UMAP results using the `ggplot` package
  - Evaluate UMAP results using graph-based clusters and other covariates
